A simple block game made in opengl(similar to Miniclip's Bloxorz).

The game has 3 basic levels.

Note-the first level is just for testing purposes and get to know the color codings of tiles.

controls:

arrow keys for movement
q to quit
t for topview
y for towerview (pressing y again leads to change in towerview)
u for followcam
i for helicam (pressing i again resets the cam)
o for block view (pressing o again changes the side)


Enjoy!
